A growing array of online EO hubs and platforms, both commercial and research focused, are emerging in response to new user requirements stimulated by this trend. These cloud platforms provide combined EO data search and generic research capabilities, often with specific tools to develop new processing workflows and scale them up to support large scale batch or scheduled processing.",

Ultimately this sector are the consumers who value the information being provided to them and who drive the requirements for information and services. The range of uses are growing and almost as broad as the entire EO user base. Providing a detailed breakdown is beyond the scope of this resource and more comprehensively addressed in EO market analyses such as those compiled by Euroconsult  and EARSC. But it is clear AI and EO will combine to provide key information across public and private sectors, input to scientific research programmes and NGOs, plus policy advice and monitoring of targets such as UN Sustainable Development Goals.",

  "description" : "With respect to ML method development, the lack of suitable training data is a frequently encountered problem. Labelled data is scarce.  The application of ML to EO data can only be realised with high-quality training data which encompasses all the features that we aim to identify, map, and monitor. A diverse and functional AI4EO ecosystem will need to include open training data libraries providing a repository for registering labelled data so that it can be discovered and shared openly. However, there is a reluctance to share such data due to a combination of technical, financial, competitive and policy constraints.",
