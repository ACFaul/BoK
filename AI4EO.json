  "description" : "Novel options for accessing and processing the EO data. A growing array of online EO hubs and platforms, both commercial and research focused, are emerging in response to new user requirements stimulated by this trend. These cloud platforms provide combined EO data search and generic research capabilities, often with specific tools to develop new processing workflows and scale them up to support large scale batch or scheduled processing.",

  "description" : "The last, but perhaps the most important group are the end users who want actionable insight from the data. Ultimately this sector are the consumers who value the information being provided to them and who drive the requirements for information and services. The range of uses are growing and almost as broad as the entire EO user base. Providing a detailed breakdown is beyond the scope of this resource and more comprehensively addressed in EO market analyses such as those compiled by Euroconsult  and EARSC. But it is clear AI and EO will combine to provide key information across public and private sectors, input to scientific research programmes and NGOs, plus policy advice and monitoring of targets such as UN Sustainable Development Goals.",
