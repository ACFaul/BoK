Providing a detailed breakdown is beyond the scope of this resource and more comprehensively addressed in EO market analyses such as those compiled by Euroconsult  and EARSC.

The application of ML to EO data can only be realised with high-quality training data which encompasses all the features that we aim to identify, map, and monitor. A diverse and functional AI4EO ecosystem will need to include open training data libraries providing a repository for registering labelled data so that it can be discovered and shared openly.
